        <h1>Index Page</h1>
        <p class="indexExp">The start of the index page started as a 3 column page and had a motherboard image as a
            background which I
            found to be fit for the purpose of the portfolio. This is the page where I figured out what I wanted the nav
            to start looking like. With that in place, I took heavy inspiration from Jack Jeznach's portfolio website
            linked here:</p>
        <p class="link">https://jacekjeznach.com</p>
        <section class="image1">

            <p class="text1">Jack Jeznach's web portfolio that inspired me</p>
        </section>
        <p class="index2">I chose to have a quick introduction of myself on the index page in order to give a breif
            overview of who I am and what I do for visitors to comprehend the purpose of the portfolio. The picture was
            chosen and placed in the center as a focus of point of my appearance as a way of achieving a rapport with
            the visitor already.</p>
        <p class="val">Below, you can see both the HTML and the CSS validation process of my website's code:</p>
        <section class="validation">
            <p class="asideText">On the top, you can see the HTML validation of the page going very well, this took me 3
                days to
                achieve as it was in the very early days of the course that we learned how to structure a page and what
                to add to it. At first, it was filled with errors and warnings about the tags i used and how the
                corresponding CSS for it was incorrect with targets all being all over the place, however, after a while
                and a lot more learning, i was able to slowly get that number of errors to none at all!</p>

            </section>
            <p class="asideText2">On the bottom is the CSS validation for the index page, here I went through so much of
                back and forth with design and placement of every element and how I wanted them to all look like on the
                page. I came out mostly with warnings and 2 errors about my grid placement which I thought was not too
                bad for the first couple of times but eventually they ended up being scrapped as they made little to no
                changes to my design and eventually the errors and warnings were gone by final touch ups!</p>

        <h1>Portfolio Page</h1>
        <p class="portExp">The portfolio page started off as a list of projects I worked on rather than a grid format of
            them. The initial plan was to have the list headings link to the projects instead of having any pictures at
            all. I wanted to have a very short and quick introduction to the webpage before I presented the projects and
            moved on so I added a heading and a one line sentence about the contents of the page. I got the idea of the
            portfolio structure and hover animations from Riccardo Zanutta's Work page linked below:</p>
        <p class="link">http://riccardozanutta.com/?ref=hackernoon.com</p>
        <p class="asideText3">Like his portfolio, I wanted to have a good hover effect when the images were hovered over
            in order to make it more dynamic and interactive for the user. I started off with a simple 1 picture per row
            but it looked so empty, so I proceeded to make it 4 in a row and have 2 rows, each with a hovering picture
            which shows a brief description of the project I worked on. I wanted to also remain consistent with the
            background image and the navigation format so I kept them the same, however, in this page was the beginning
            of the footer of every page which had undergone several changes from the start to the final edit. It started
            off as just the icons on the bottom right of the page and it slowly evolved to being in the center of the
            bottom of the page. It looked bland at first which led me to add a background to it which complimented the
            black of the motherboard background of the whole page. With the hover effect, I wanted the image to be
            overlayed with a grey background where you can see the picture but also have the sense of selection. I
            decided that the best way to have the text appear on the overlay was to have it slide up from the bottom,
            which was the most appealing way to show animation to the eye. The the curved borders were a no brainer as
            the rectangular shape of the images and overlay looked so plain and basic whereas I wanted the boxes to look
            dynamic and smooth.

        <h1 class="cPage">Contact Page</h1>
        <p class="contactExp">With the contact page, it was genuinely just a matter of formatting because the page is
            basically just a form below a heading which needs to open in the user's default mail software/browser. I
            decided on the required fields to be the first name, surname and email address- these would be used in order
            for me to contact the visitor easily and quicker. I added a relatively large text area on the form table in
            order to give the visitor as much space as they need for a message.</p>
        <p class="contactExp2">For this page, there was no inspiration but the basic contact form you'd see anywhere. I
            wanted to have both labels and placeholders so it becomes easier to know what you're entering and where
            because many times, I personally got confused by them. The submit button looked off place when in one column
            so i made it spread across the 2 columns I have for the form and had the classic green color as the
            background. I had stars (*) reference the fact that the input was required and placed that
            sentence/statement just above the footer on the left hand side - I also wanted to have the asterisks red to
            pop them out.

        <h1 class="bPage">Blog page</h1>
        <p class="blogExp">
            With the final page of the website, as always, I wanted to stay consistent with the navigation bar and the
            background. However, this page took so much longer because the only reference for a blog that I had in my
            head was really outdated and I also never really read nor visited a blog before. So, naturally, I resorted
            to the internet and looked around which resulted in my inspiration for the whole page; Florin Pop's Blog
            Page on his website.
            Below, you can find his blog webpage:
        </p>
        <p class="link">https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/</p>
        <p class="asideBlog">Florin's blog had a nice hover effect that I wanted to use minus the added shadows on his
            blog entry boxes. Unlike his, my entries are not clickable so they don't lead to places whereas his blog
            posts are anchored to a new page where he elaborates on the subject further and further. The whole theme of
            my blog page is an entry per eventful session like making a new page or major changes to existing pages, and
            that way the page looks more organized in chronological order. The hover effect gave it a more dynamic look
            on the entries but also gave it a less boring shape to the page.

        <h1 class="mobileVersion">Mobile version of the website</h1>
        <p class="mobExp">Optimizing the mobile version of the website was crucial because it meant that the navigation
            bar had to be compressed into a hamburger icon that can turn on and off by click while displaying the
            navigation but also turning it off. This didn't take much time but the process of it took me long to
            understand and execute into the navigation bar. Finally, all that was left was to edit the website in mobile
            mode and make it look mobile friendly.

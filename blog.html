                    <h2>The Start of A New Website</h2>
                    <section class="blog-content">
                        <p>We started the lesson learning the basics of HTML and how to easily create a basic website page. Our excersises were very basic like changing colours and having background colours for different elements on the page.</p>

                    <h2>A Whole New Perspective</h2>
                    <section class="blog-content">
                        <p>The lecture began as we recapped the basics, the elements and all the tags we used last week. We then began to learn more complex CSS concepts like float, which was then made clear to us, that it is a way more complex method of solving things that need placement on the web page. Grids was then introduced to us as if to be a grace from heaven to save our float problems.</p>

                    <h2>Eyes Wide Open</h2>
                    <section class="blog-content">
                        <p>This very website began actual development on the night of the 8th of March as we further explore the possibilities of grid and making the hamburger icon for the mobile version of the website, that then turned into more experimenting with navigation looks on a mobile site so that optimization could be achieved. Animations and transitions was the next part of our project as it turned out that it plays a more massive role than we initially thought it would. However, application of it and implementing it to the actual website was as easy as pi.</p>

                    <h2>More of An Exploration</h2>
                    <section class="blog-content">
                        <p>The grid structure of the website started taking shape 2 days after the lesson, the formation of everything started making sense to me and I envisioned everything in place. From there, I began planning out how I wanted the website to look like and include hover effects and animations to my navigation bar. Along with that, the index page was finally complete and I was happy with the way it turned out because that is how I wanted it to look based on a landing page on a portfolio I saw on the internet.</p>

                    <section class="blog-content">
                        <p>The day of the lesson was when we began introduction to Git and GitHub, from there, we initialized a repository and began git configuration to our repos. From there, we started on publishing our work to GitHub and begin commits and merging more branches as we go along making the website.</p>

                    <section class="blog-content">
                        <p>Today, the contact page was started and also finalized to look the way I wanted it to, which meant I could start with working on the final 2 pages of the website. The blog started coming along very very nicely and the contact page was adjusted to be formatted better on the html, other than that, the blog page began construction soon after and I took heavy inspiration from Florin Pop's blog page on his website</p>

                    <section class="blog-content">
                        <p>The end of the blog page came today and the beginning of the experience page began anew. There may still be entries every now and then but the format and personalization is done. The experience page is coming along very smoothly, I'm beginning to see a format in my head for it and I want to execute it with perfection. Most, if not all, of my validation checks and references are ready and in files to be placed, all thats left is placing them on the website and making it look pretty!</p>
